Importing data from @allison2020 about rock juggling in to different species of otter.

```{r}
#| average-juggling-sex
data_juggling |> 
  group_by(sex) |> 
  summarise(Mean_rock_juggling = mean(rock_juggling))
```

Plotting the age against the amount of rock juggling between the sex.

```{r}
#| plot-data

plot_juggling <- ggplot(data_juggling, aes(x = age, y = rock_juggling), fill = sex)+
  geom_point(aes(colour = sex))+
  geom_smooth()+ 
  labs(x = "Age",
       y = " Total observation of rock juggle",
       title = "Rock juggling against age")
plot_juggling
```

```{r}
#| boxplot-species

plot_hunger <- ggplot(data_hunger, aes(x= hungry, y = rock_juggling))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs( x = "Hunger",
        y = "Rock juggling occurences",
        title = "Species against Rock juggling")
